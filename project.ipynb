    "## What is a t-test?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **t-test** is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. It is particularly useful when the sample size is small and the population variance is unknown. There are several variations of the t-test, but the most common ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independent t-test**: Compares the means of two independent groups.\n",
    "2. **Paired t-test**: Compares the means of two related groups (e.g., before and after measurements).\n",
    "3. **One-sample t-test**: Compares the mean of a sample to a known value (e.g., population mean).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the t-test Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-test calculates a **t-statistic**, which is a measure of the difference between the group means in relation to the variation within the groups. It then compares the t-statistic to a critical value from the **t-distribution** to assess whether the observed difference is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the t-statistic is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",

    "- \\(\\bar{X_1}\\) and \\(\\bar{X_2}\\) are the sample means of the two groups,\n",
    "- \\(s_1^2\\) and \\(s_2^2\\) are the sample variances,\n",
    "- \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the sample sizes of the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions of a t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "For the t-test to be valid, the following assumptions should be met:\n",
    "1. **Normality**: The data in each group should follow a normal distribution, especially for small sample sizes.\n",
    "2. **Independence**: The samples should be independent of each other.\n",
    "3. **Homogeneity of variances**: The variances of the two groups should be equal (for independent t-tests).\n",

    "Observations are independent.\n",
    "6. Why Use ANOVA Instead of Multiple t-tests?\n",
    "Increased Error Rate: Conducting multiple t-tests increases the likelihood of Type I errors (false positives) because each test has its own significance threshold.\n",
    "Holistic Approach: ANOVA considers all group comparisons simultaneously, providing a single test statistic.\n",
    "Efficiency: ANOVA is computationally more efficient and interprets overall group differences in one step.\n",
