    "## Project (40%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Ideas\n",
    "Complete the project in a single notebook called project.ipynb in your repository. The same style should be used as detailed above: explanations in MarkDown and code comments, clean code, and regular commits. Use plots as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will analyze the PlantGrowth R dataset. You will find a short description of it on Vicent Arel-Bundock's Rdatasets page. The dataset contains two main variables, a treatment group and the weight of plants within those groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to perform t-tests and ANOVA on this dataset while describing the dataset and explaining your work. In doing this you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and save the dataset to your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe the data set in your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe what a t-test is, how it works, and what the assumptions are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform a t-test to determine whether there is a significant difference between the two treatment groups trt1 and trt2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform ANOVA to determine whether there is a significant difference between the three treatment groups ctrl, trt1, and trt2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain why it is more appropriate to apply ANOVA rather than several t-tests when analyzing more than two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marking Scheme\n",
    "Each component will be graded based on the following four categories. Each category carries equal weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, your repository is what will be evaluated. It should demonstrate evidence of the criteria outlined for each category. That said, the examiners' overall impression of the submission may affect marks in each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to make steady progress on the assessment throughout the semester. This should be reflected in your commit history. Huge commits, especially late in the semester, will not be accepted. At any stage you may be asked to discuss the work to date in your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter issues with your repository, seek help well before the deadline. Do not delete any files or commits without first consulting the lecturer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research\n",
    "Evidence of research on relevant topics.\n",
    "Appropriate referencing.\n",
    "Building upon the literature and documentation.\n",
    "Comparisons to similar work.\n",
    "Development\n",
    "Clear, concise, and correct code.\n",
    "Appropriate tests.\n",
    "Knowledge of different approaches and algorithms.\n",
    "Clean architecture.\n",
    "Documentation\n",
    "Clear explanations of concepts.\n",
    "Concise comments in code and elsewhere.\n",
    "Appropriate README for repository.\n",
    "Consistency\n",
    "Tens of commits, each representing a reasonable amount of work.\n",
    "Literature, documentation, and code evidencing work on the assessment.\n",
    "Evidence of reviewing and refactoring.\n",
    "Advice\n",
    "The freedom provided in open-style assessments such as this one can feel challenging. You need to decide how to start, what content to include, how much to cover, and how to make the work your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessment is designed to provide you with opportunities for independent thinking and decision-making. Employers value graduates who can take initiative, work independently, and make design decisions with minimal guidance. We expect you to have basic programming knowledge and be able to find information on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have a clear plan before you start coding. Your submission should include both your plan and an explanation of any design choices you made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to follow ATU's policies and regulations which are on the Student Hub. Pay particular attention to any policies on plagiarism and the Student Code. If you're unsure about anything, ask the lecturer."
